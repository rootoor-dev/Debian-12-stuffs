The error `user lacks privilege or object not found` in **SQLite**, **HSQLDB** or **H2** can have various causes. 
Based on the provided solutions and context found checking the Internet, here are some suggestions:

# JDBC templates for databases

The JDBC URL syntax varies across different database systems, and there isn't a single global syntax that fits all databases. Each database system has its own conventions and features, and the JDBC URL is designed to accommodate these specifics.

However, there are some common patterns that you might find across different JDBC URLs:

```java

jdbc:<subprotocol>:<subname>
```
- `jdbc`: Indicates that JDBC is being used.
- `<subprotocol>`: The database-specific subprotocol, which defines how the JDBC driver connects to the database.
- `<subname>`: Database-specific information that is required by the JDBC driver to connect to the database, such as the host, port, database name, and additional parameters.

```
YOUR-DATABASE-ENGINE-NAME-HERE Database Engine Standalone : jdbc:«database-engine-name-here?»:file:«database/path?»
YOUR-DATABASE-ENGINE-NAME-HERE Database Engine In-Memory : jdbc:«database-engine-name-here?»:mem:«database/path?»
YOUR-DATABASE-ENGINE-NAME-HERE Database Engine Server : jdbc:«database-engine-name-here?»:«database-engine-name-here?»://localhost/«database/path?»
YOUR-DATABASE-ENGINE-NAME-HERE Database Engine WebServer : jdbc:«database-engine-name-here?»:http://«hostname/databasename?»
```

### For HSQLDB

```java
HSQLDB Database Engine Standalone : jdbc:hsqldb:file:«database/path?»
HSQLDB Database Engine In-Memory : jdbc:hsqldb:mem:«database/path?»
HSQLDB Database Engine Server : jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/«database/path?»
HSQLDB Database Engine WebServer : jdbc:hsqldb:http://«hostname/databasename?»
```


### For H2:

#### Standalone (File):
```java
// H2 Database Engine Standalone
String h2FileStandaloneURL = "jdbc:h2:file:/path/to/your/database";

// H2 Database Engine In-Memory
String h2MemURL = "jdbc:h2:mem:yourdatabase";

// H2 Database Engine Server
String h2ServerURL = "jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/yourdatabase";

// H2 Database Engine WebServer
String h2WebServerURL = "jdbc:h2:http://localhost/yourdatabase";
```

### For SQLite:

#### Standalone (File):
```java
// SQLite Database Engine Standalone
String sqliteFileStandaloneURL = "jdbc:sqlite:/path/to/your/database";

// SQLite Database Engine In-Memory (SQLite does not support in-memory databases in the same way as H2)
String sqliteMemURL = "jdbc:sqlite::memory:";

// SQLite Database Engine Server (SQLite does not have a dedicated server mode like H2)
// Example: Use a shared file/database accessible by multiple clients
String sqliteServerURL = "jdbc:sqlite:/path/to/shared/database";

// SQLite Database Engine WebServer (SQLite does not have a dedicated web server mode)
// Example: Connect to a remote SQLite database using a server
String sqliteWebServerURL = "jdbc:sqlite:http://hostname/yourdatabase";
```

Note:
- SQLite has some differences compared to H2. It doesn't have a dedicated server mode or web server mode like H2.
- SQLite's "in-memory" database is a different concept compared to other databases. The `::memory:` URL creates an in-memory database, but it is not shared between different connections or processes.

Adjust these URLs based on your specific requirements and configurations. Ensure that you replace placeholders like `/path/to/your/database`, `yourdatabase`, `localhost`, etc., with your actual database details.

# Solutions

## Best Solution
`user lacks privilege or object not found` can have multiple causes, the most obvious being you're accessing a table that does not exist or is not created with correct rights. 

## filepath : jdbc:THE-DATABASE-ENGINE-USED:file:«database/path?»
Our database files are preferentially located at `/home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/`. You can adapt to your convenience.

- H2 : `jdbc:h2:file:/home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/h2testdb`
- HSQLDB : `jdbc:hsql:file:/home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/h2testdb`
- SQLite : `jdbc:sqlite:file:/home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/h2testdb`

```shell
# create the repersotry
mkdir /home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/ && cd /home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/
# create the database file named "mydatabase" or with extension suchas ".db", ".sqlite", etc.
touch mydatabase.db
# IMPORTANT STEP : give "read and write rights" to the created file of the database
chmod 775 mydatabase.db
```
## OTHER SOLUTION (replace HSQLDB by your database engine)
### Solution 1:
#### Issue: Database Alias Name in Connection String
- Ensure that the database alias name is correct in your connection string.
- Double-check the URL. Example: `jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/sdb`.
- Try creating your new table in the PUBLIC schema, as the driver typically searches for tables there by default.

### Solution 2:
#### Issue: Case Sensitivity in Table Names
- HSQLDB is case-sensitive. Ensure that the table name in the database matches the definition in your code. Check for case differences, especially in uppercase or lowercase letters.

### Solution 3:
#### Issue: Incorrect Entity Field Types
- Check your entity field types. Ensure they match the data types expected in the database schema.
- Use appropriate field types to prevent issues. For example, if using Double or Long classes incorrectly, switch to the correct field types.

### Solution 4:
#### Issue: Spring Batch Tables Initialization
- If you are using Spring Boot with Spring Batch and encounter issues related to table initialization, make sure that the Spring Batch tables are properly initialized.
- Set the property `spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema` to `always` in your application properties.

### General Tips:
- When connecting through Java, specify the filedb location in the connection string. Example: `jdbc:hsqldb:file:C:\servers\DB\hsqldb240\testdb;ifexists=true;`.

### Additional Steps:
- Connect directly to the database using a database client or tool and run queries to ensure the table exists and the user has the necessary privileges.
- Verify the actual name of the table in the database for troubleshooting purposes.

By addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the "user lacks privilege or object not found" error in HSQLDB. Adjust your configuration, connection strings, and entity definitions accordingly.

The error `user lacks privilege or object not found` in **SQLite**, **HSQLDB** or **H2** can have various causes. 
Based on the provided solutions and context found checking the Internet, here are some suggestions:

# Solutions

## Best Solution
`user lacks privilege or object not found` can have multiple causes, the most obvious being you're accessing a table that does not exist or is not created with correct rights. 

## filepath : jdbc:THE-DATABASE-ENGINE-USED:file:«database/path?»
Our database files are preferentially located at `/home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/`. You can adapt to your convenience.

- H2 : `jdbc:h2:file:/home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/h2testdb`
- HSQLDB : `jdbc:hsql:file:/home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/h2testdb`
- SQLite : `jdbc:sqlite:file:/home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/h2testdb`

```shell
# create the repersotry
mkdir /home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/ && cd /home/YOUR-USERNAME/Templates/db/
# create the database file named "mydatabase" or with extension suchas ".db", ".sqlite", etc.
touch mydatabase.db
# IMPORTANT STEP : give "read and write rights" to the created file of the database
chmod 775 mydatabase.db
```
## OTHER SOLUTION (replace HSQLDB by your database engine)
### Solution 1:
#### Issue: Database Alias Name in Connection String
- Ensure that the database alias name is correct in your connection string.
- Double-check the URL. Example: `jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/sdb`.
- Try creating your new table in the PUBLIC schema, as the driver typically searches for tables there by default.

### Solution 2:
#### Issue: Case Sensitivity in Table Names
- HSQLDB is case-sensitive. Ensure that the table name in the database matches the definition in your code. Check for case differences, especially in uppercase or lowercase letters.

### Solution 3:
#### Issue: Incorrect Entity Field Types
- Check your entity field types. Ensure they match the data types expected in the database schema.
- Use appropriate field types to prevent issues. For example, if using Double or Long classes incorrectly, switch to the correct field types.

### Solution 4:
#### Issue: Spring Batch Tables Initialization
- If you are using Spring Boot with Spring Batch and encounter issues related to table initialization, make sure that the Spring Batch tables are properly initialized.
- Set the property `spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema` to `always` in your application properties.

### General Tips:
- When connecting through Java, specify the filedb location in the connection string. Example: `jdbc:hsqldb:file:C:\servers\DB\hsqldb240\testdb;ifexists=true;`.

### Additional Steps:
- Connect directly to the database using a database client or tool and run queries to ensure the table exists and the user has the necessary privileges.
- Verify the actual name of the table in the database for troubleshooting purposes.

By addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the "user lacks privilege or object not found" error in HSQLDB. Adjust your configuration, connection strings, and entity definitions accordingly.
